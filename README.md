# Upslope-speed-calculation
This are the three programs to calculate the uphill speed/required power of the RainyFlyer vehicle (and potentially many other vehicles), given required slope and train dimensions.
RainyFlyer MK1/2/3 corresponds to the stats of these three trains, and slope data is based on Rainy Ridge Incline.
